## Introduction
Never a satisfied customer, Aiden has asked you to expand the receipt generator that you created in Project 1 and updated in Project 2. Now Aiden wants to optimize his supply chain and ensure tips are being distributed correctly.

In the previous project, your application was extended to add a cashier name, date, and order number that update with usage. In the new application, Aiden will be able to see a running log of all the receipts generated by the application.

Nothing should change in the front-end functionality of the application between Project 2 and Project 3. Instead, all of the changes will happen behind-the-scenes.

When the application starts, it should check to see if the file named `receipts.csv` exists. If the file does not exist, the application should create the file and add the following header row.

```
#,timestamp,cashier,coffee,bakery,discount,tax,tip,total
```

When a receipt is generated, a new line should be appended (added to the bottom of the file). The example below shows a receipt and its corresponding line in the `receipts.csv` file.

```

In addition, you must modify your code so that there is a class named `Receipt` that contains an attribute for each of the receipt inputs. Move all the receipt calculations and printing into methods of this class.

## Goals

This project demonstrates your ability to:

1. Work with files
2. Write and use classes

## Requirements

1. The application must be written in `project_03.py`


2. The application must have a comment at the top of the file with the following information.
   1. Your name
   2. The date you last update the application.
   3. The application name.
   4. A short description of the application

3. When the application first starts, it must accept the name of the cashier and use this throughout.

4. After starting and after generating each receipt, the application must ask whether the user wants to generate another receipt.

5. For each receipt, the application must accept the following inputs. You may assume that the user will input a valid value. You **do not** need to handle invalid input.
   1. The number of coffee items as an integer >= 0.
   2. The number of bakery items as an integer >= 0.
   3. A discount percentage as an integer from 0 to 100.
   4. A tip amount as a float >= 0.

6. The application must output the receipt exactly as shown in the examples. This includes:
   1. The business name (Line 1).
   2. The cashier, purchase timestamp, and order # (Lines 2-7).
   3. The number of items purchased, cost per item, and line-item totals (Lines 8-14).
   4. The subtotal, discount rate, discount, tax, and tip (Lines 15-19).
   5. The total and a footer message (Line 20).

7. The application must use the user's input as the cashier.

8. The application must use the current timestamp as the purchase timestamp.

9. The application must use sequential order numbers. Whenever the application is run, the first receipt will be order 1, the second receipt will be order 2, and so on.

10. The application must not print items the customer does not order.

11. The application must calculate all subtotals and totals accurately.

12. The application must create `receipts.csv` and add the specified header when the file does not exist.
    1. The application must not add a header row if the file already exists.

13. The application must add a row to the `receipts.csv` file each time a receipt is generated.

14. The application must define a `Receipt` class and use it for all receipt calculation and printing, with the exception of the file output.

## Grading
Grading will not be done automatically on push like the labs. Instead, it will be performed after final submission. Your application will be tested against a range of inputs which are designed to make it fail. It will be graded against the following criteria.

1. Correct calculations and output format (25 pts)
2. Correct output of `receipts.csv` (50 pts)
3. Appropriate definition and usage of a `Receipt` class. (50 pts)

Take time to consider the different "edge cases" that could be given to your application.
